# GMM-BgExtractor
A C++ implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models for background removal from Stauffer and Grimson's 1999 paper.

Stauffer, Chris, and W. Eric L. Grimson. "Adaptive background mixture models for real-time tracking." Proceedings. 1999 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat. No PR00149). Vol. 2. IEEE, 1999.

I'm not going to make any claims about the speed of this implementation, my focus was getting some experience with C++ and implementing something interesting.
